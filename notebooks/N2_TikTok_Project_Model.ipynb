Given the vast number of videos created and watched every day, a substantial number of these get reportedâ€”far too many for human moderators to review individually.\n","\n","Our analysis shows that users who violate terms of service are more likely to present claims rather than opinions. Thus, distinguishing between claim and opinion videos is essential.\n","\n","TikTok plans to develop a machine learning model to identify claims and opinions. Videos identified as opinions will have a lower chance of being reviewed by human moderators. In contrast, videos identified as claims will be further processed to determine their review priority. For example, claim videos might be ranked by the number of reports they receive, with the top percentage being reviewed by humans each day.\n","\n","This machine learning model will significantly help human moderators focus on videos most likely to violate TikTok's terms of service.\n","\n","\n","### **1. Modeling design and target variable**\n","\n","The data dictionary shows that there is a column called `claim_status`. This is a binary value that indicates whether a video is a claim or an opinion. This will be the target variable. In other words, for each video, the model should predict whether the video is a claim or an opinion.\n","\n","This is a **classification task** because the model is predicting a binary class."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### **2. Selecting an evaluation metric**\n","\n","To determine which evaluation metric might be best, consider how the model might be wrong. There are two possibilities for bad predictions:\n","\n","  - **False positives:** When the model predicts a video is a claim when in fact it is an opinion\n","  - **False negatives:** When the model predicts a video is an opinion when in fact it is a claim\n","\n","\n","\n","### **3. What are the ethical implications of building the model?**\n","In the given scenario, it's better for the model to predict false positives when it makes a mistake, and worse for it to predict false negatives. It's very important to identify videos that break the terms of service, even if that means some opinion videos are misclassified as claims. The worst case for an opinion misclassified as a claim is that the video goes to human review. The worst case for a claim that's misclassified as an opinion is that the video does not get reviewed _and_ it violates the terms of service. A video that violates the terms of service would be considered posted from a \"banned\" author, as referenced in the data dictionary.\n","\n","Because it's more important to minimize false negatives, the model evaluation metric will be **recall**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### **4. How would we proceed?**\n","\n","**Modeling workflow and model selection process**\n","\n","Previous work with this data has revealed that there are ~20,000 videos in the sample. This is sufficient to conduct a rigorous model validation workflow, broken into the following steps:\n","\n","1. Split the data into train/validation/test sets (60/20/20)\n","2. Fit models and tune hyperparameters on the training set\n","3. Perform final model selection on the validation set\n","4.
